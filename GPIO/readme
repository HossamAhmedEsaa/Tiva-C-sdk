This GPIO drivers was built according to Texas Instrument file strucure.

It contains multiple layers as follows :

1- RAL : Register Abstraction Layer -> this layer includes the physical micro controllers addresses.
2- HAL : Hardware Absraction layer  -> this layer includes the atomoic functions related to the GPIO module.
3- ECU : Elecronic Components Unit  -> this layer includes the electronic componenets inerface functions.
4- SL  : Service Layer
5- APP : Appliction Layer           -> this layer manages the interaction between more than one MCU module.

=====================================================================

Main Rules :

1- There is no interaction between two modules in the same layer.
2- The lower layers can not ineract with higher layers except for call back functions.
3- The higher layer can interact with lower layers.
